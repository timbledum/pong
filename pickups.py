"""Special pickups!

This module defines a class which keeps track of pickups and then their resulting effects.

It also defines mini containers to hold the pickup objects to display, and the
actual pickup types.

The module exposes the effects of pickups in three ways:
1. self.is_condition_active: check whether the condition is currently active
2. PickupType(enter=function): the function which is triggered when a pickup is picked up
3. PickupType(exit=function): the function which is triggered when the condition finishes
                              (usually to revert the state to normal)
